## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Kotlin**: Ensure you have the Kotlin compiler and runtime installed. Download it from [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/).
2. **Set Up Jetpack Compose for Desktop**: Follow the official setup guide at [JetBrains Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-multiplatform).
3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/amazon-style-compose-app.git
   ```
4. **Open in IDE**: Launch the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another compatible IDE.
5. **Build the Project**: Run the build process to download dependencies and compile the code.

---

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main` function in `main.kt` from your IDE.
2. **Login Screen**: 
   - Enter any non-empty username and password (no real authentication is implemented).
   - Check "Show Password" to toggle visibility.
   - Click **Login** to proceed.
3. **Main Dashboard**:
   - Explore the search bar (placeholder functionality).
   - View the promotional banner and dummy content.
   - Click a category card (e.g., "Electronics") to navigate to its screen.
   - Use the **Logout** button to return to the login screen.
4. **Category Screen**:
   - Browse dummy items in a grid layout.
   - Click **Back** to return to the dashboard.

*The application launches in a window sized 1024x768 pixels with a minimum size constraint.*

## Code Structure
The entire project resides in `main.kt`, organized as follows:

- **Theme Definition**: Custom `MyDarkPalette` for dark mode styling.
- **Screen Enum**: `Screen` class defining `Login`, `Main`, and `Category` states.
- **Composables**:
  - `LoginScreen`: Login UI and logic.
  - `MainScreen` & `CompleteMainPage`: Dashboard with categories and extra content.
  - `CategoryScreen`: Category-specific item display.
  - Helper components like `CategoryCard`, `ItemCard`, `SearchBar`, etc.
- **Main Function**: Application entry point with window setup and navigation logic.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following technologies:

| Dependency            | Purpose                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Jetpack Compose       | UI toolkit for desktop apps   |
| Kotlin Standard Library | Core language functionality |

*Note: Dependencies are typically managed via Gradle, but no build file is provided here.*

---

## Design Choices
- **Dark Theme**: Uses a custom palette (e.g., `#BB86FC` for primary) to align with modern UI trends and enhance readability.
- **Amazon-Inspired Layout**: Mimics e-commerce dashboards with a search bar, promotional banner, and grid-based categories.
- **Navigation**: Employs a `mutableStateOf` for simple, reactive screen transitions.

---

## Screen Navigation
Navigation is handled via a state machine. Hereâ€™s how screens transition:

| Current Screen | Action            | Next Screen |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Login          | Successful Login  | Main        |
| Main           | Select Category   | Category    |
| Main           | Logout            | Login       |
| Category       | Back              | Main        |

## UI Components
Key reusable components in the project:

| Component          | Description                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `LoginScreen`      | Form for username/password entry with login button      |
| `MainScreen`       | Dashboard with search, banner, and category grid        |
| `CategoryScreen`   | Grid of items for a selected category                   |
| `CategoryCard`     | Clickable card for category selection                   |
| `ItemCard`         | Dummy item representation in category screens           |
| `SearchBar`        | Placeholder search input field                          |
| `PromotionalBanner`| Gradient-styled banner with promotional text            |
| `AppFooter`        | Copyright notice at the bottom                          |
| `ExtraContentArea` | Combines dummy sections and footer for the dashboard    |

## Color Palette
The dark theme is defined with these colors:

| Color           | Hex Code   | Usage            |
|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| Primary         | #BB86FC    | Buttons, accents |
